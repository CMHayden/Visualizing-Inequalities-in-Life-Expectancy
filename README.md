# Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy

The aim of this project is to answer some fundamental questions about life expectancy. Using the UN data for life expectancy at birth, I will answer some of these questions, such as do women live longer than men? How long? Does it happen everywhere? Is life expectancy increasing? Everywhere? Which is the country with the lowest life expectancy? Which is the one with the highest?

## UN Data for life expectancy at birth

This dataset contains the average life expectancies of men and women by country (in years). It covers four periods: 1985-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, and 2000-2005. The columns are as followed:

* **Country or Area** Stores the country.

* **Subgroup** Stores the gender as Female or Male.

* **Year** Stores the year period (ie, 2000-2005).

* **Source** Stores the source of where this data was taken from.

* **Unit** Stores the unit in which life expectancy is measured. Is always Years.

* **Value** Stores the number of associated units in which a person is expected to live.

## Visualizations

Visualizations will be created with this dataset. The key visualizations to create are:

* Change of life expectancy over the time periods for men in the United Kingdom.

* Change of life expectancy over the time periods for women in Australia.

* Life expectancy for a man and a woman born in 1994 in Spain.

*More TBD*

## Statistical Analysis

This will aim to answer questions such as:

* Whats the worst country and time period in which someone could be born, regardless of gender?

* Do women live longer than men? If so, how long? Does it happen everywhere?

* Is life expectancy increasing? If so, everywhere?

* What is the average life expectancy for a person born in the world?
